However I didn’t say it’s impossible to stop this.,How dare you .,With ALL DO respect! I appreciate her time in doing her research that says a lot about her zeal in wanting to fight for what she is passionate about. However, I am an engineer at heart and only take my sources from those who are FAR more educated into the actual research process than reading things online and reading books.. I need to see tests performed by the ARGUER to prove their hypothesis and thesis.. Until she gets in college and graduate with a doctorate degree in Agricultural Sciences I can't attach my beliefs with her numbers.. Some of it doesn't even make sense for today's projections and I sense a bit of bias coming from her as Climate Change is not the only doom to our future realistically speaking... It's a combination of MULTIPLE things.. There are always more than one variable to something crazily complex.,How dare you!?,Greta: “You have stolen my childhood.”

damn wish my childhood got stolen like that....,Sick child.,This Gretta is the most scary, angry and irritating person that I have ever seen, she reminds me of a dictator..

She speaks with such anger that her face is red with her jugular veins popping out and her teeth are clinching with eyes afire 🔥 and narrowly focused like laser's..

This person has mental issues taking on a popular subject in order for people to notice her, her speech is well thought out to get the most reaction...

She should be annoying the people that ARE part of the biggest polluting countries in Asia and not pissing us off with her hate speaches while we struggle with all types of pollution taxes that are just an excuse for government cash grab that dosen't solve the global polution problem...

The problem is that nobody would listen to her outside of the English speaking countries, so she irritates us instead.,DEAR RIGHT WING TROLLS: Mark my words, when you are older, and you are frail and depend on younger generations to take care of you, even if you have the wealth to pay for it, you will be ignored and get what you deserve.,Mal lan bu (Türkler beğen),Sounds like she's reading for a Harry Potter part?,I don’t understand why governments using little kids to get more taxes with the name of climate change.

Greta thurnburg: how dare you,I don’t find this as being humorous at all but very sad, because this young girl is being used to push narratives and fear that she sincerely believes to be fact. She has a genuine fear and passion to try to change her perceived future based on the lies she has been indoctrinated with. I have a feeling that she has been living under this heavy cloud for most of her life and this is all she has ever heard. She sincerely believes what she has been taught is based on evidence instead of theory. For all those who think this is funny or entertaining and they even have the audacity to criticize or insult this young girl in any way; think outside of your little box that you are in for once and try to understand what it would be like to grow up all of your life hearing the narratives about climate change, global warming, and the doomed future of the earth because of fossil fuels. Even though this young girl has been misinformed about the facts, she deserves to be complimented for speaking up for what she believes at such a young age. Even though I don’t agree with her message, I respect her a lot more than I respect those who want to make fun, criticize or insults her in any way.,yeah we did it 100k dislikes,So much material for SNL sketches,great gay,“Shut up Meg”,Döda Greta hihi:),За то видно сколько в мире овец и баранов.,Yes, this is all wrong, you shouldn't be up there... go home LoL,I have a dream.

Autism also isn't a mental illness its a medical condition. People with autism also tend to be overly sensitive and suffer with poor decision making and impulse control. Mix that with Depression and you have a 80% chance of self terminating. Greta has also stated she is  OCD and selective mutism which are sign of sever mental illness and when mixed with depression can make you prone to delusions and psychoses.,This girl's got balls to talk to them like that good job completely agree👍,Me going to the comments instead of watching the video.

Sorry but we don’t allow brats to run the country I live in,I don't think it is wrong a child having these thoughts, but why should this be one of the UN's talks?

Who are these naive gullible lost souls ?,Long story short:
“How dare you?!”,This girl is clearly misguided and clearly muliplated through her emotions. She has been told knowledge given from a higher authority that she clearly doesn't understand. Her emotions are sincere which makes people think or feel that is coming from a good place. People please have discernment in the last days,  theologies, philosophies, and other ways of thinking will appear in the last days. Children are often used to push an agenda by unseen authorities to gain the people's heart's and mind's. Discernment is the key!!!!,Remember the medevil warm period? Just as warm as now. Oh wait!
